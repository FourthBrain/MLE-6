Use `FastAPI_hello_world` and `FastAPI_HuggingFace` to Deploy a <i>containerized, local</i> web application capable of analyzing sentiment of any given sentence.

You may use `FastAPI` (as above), `Flask`, or `Django`.

For more information on how to write a `Dockerfile` to deploy containerized applications, check out our [Dockerfile Guide](https://github.com/FourthBrain/MLO3/blob/main/guides/dockerfile_guide.md)

###### Deliverables:
- Submit a link to your GitHub repo
- Include a README.md in your GitHub repo that details how to use your containerized web app (e.g., see [step-by-step-nlp](https://github.com/FourthBrain/step-by-step-nlp-dialogpt-chatbot) as an example)
